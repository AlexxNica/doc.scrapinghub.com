Plans & Pricing
===============

Pay as you go plan
------------------

The Pay as you go plan runs your spiders in shared servers that are allocated
to deal with the capacity demand of all Scrapinghub users.

Dedicated servers
-----------------

In the dedicated server plan, we deploy a dedicated server where all your
spiders will run, not sharing any computing resources with other customer
spiders. At the moment, dedicated servers are powered by Amazon EC2 small
instances. More powerful severs can be requested, but it's often suggested to
allocated multiple dedicated servers instead of more powerful ones.
