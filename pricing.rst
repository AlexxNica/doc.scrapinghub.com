Pay As You Go Plan
==================

The *Pay As You Go* plan runs your spiders on shared servers that are allocated to deal with the capacity demand of all Scrapinghub users.

Dedicated Server Plan
=====================

In the *Dedicated Server* plan, we deploy a dedicated server where all your spiders will run, not sharing any computing resources with other customers' spiders. At the moment, dedicated servers are powered by Amazon EC2 small instances. More powerful servers can be requested, but it's often suggested to allocate multiple dedicated servers instead of more powerful ones.
