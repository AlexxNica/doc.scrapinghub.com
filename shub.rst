.. _shub:

Scrapinghub command line client
===============================

``shub`` is the Scrapinghub command line client. It allows you to deploy
projects or dependencies, schedule spiders, and retrieve scraped data or logs
without leaving the command line.

If you have ``pip`` installed on your system, you can install ``shub`` from
the Python Package Index::

    pip install shub

We also supply stand-alone binaries. You can find them in our `latest GitHub
release`_.

The documentation is available online via Read the Docs:
